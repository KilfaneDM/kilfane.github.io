# About Me
My name is Daren Murray. I am currently working on earning an IT: Software Developer certificate from New Brunswick Community College.  
I've been using computers for almost my whole life, but have only been learning programming for a few years now.  
I also compete at a national level in the fighting game Tekken 8.  

# Skills
I am proficient in C#, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, OracleSQL, and C++.  
I am comfortable using the Microsoft suite of coding tools, such as Visual Studio, VS Code, and Microsoft Database Management software, as well as the IntelliJ IDE for java.  
I can also do modeling in Blender, and am proficient in the Unity game engine.  
Am comfortable working on either Windows or Linux-Based Operating systems.  

# Projects
I am currently working on an unnamed game as a side project, it is not very far along at the moment.  
In high school, I helped program a golf playing robot for a robotics competition at Acadia University; our team took 13th out of 50 teams.  

# Experience
I have done lots off work as a groundskeeper, and as a Doordash driver during school semesters. I have not yet found employment in the IT industry.  

# Education
